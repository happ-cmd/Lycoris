# Deepwoken Rewrite
**No modules were updated.**

**No timings were updated.**
*If you now see the base combat, you will see something a little different on M1s and Flourishes. I made them more precise, or atleast tried to.*

**Any new features?**
```diff
- (bug fix) Manually managed notifications now use the scaled notification size
- (bug fix) Info spoofing has now perfect removal with no gaps (this would always activate on injection)
- (bug fix) Info spoofing now does not set some manual text settings when it is turned off (preventing it from showing on injection)
- (bug fix) When disabled per-timing player prediction was on, it would force itself on for other-prediction-based stuff.
- (bug fix) Made the dynamic bounding box search for body parts more strictly
- (bug fix) Dynamic bounding box now invalidates the cache when the detected size has increased by a large amount
+ (changed) Timing probabilities list is now alphabetically sorted
+ (changed) Auto parry now respects AP frames (please report any issues with this, I remember some on Legacy; it should say it detected AP frames in notifications)
+ (added) Auto mantra followup
+ (added) Visual option to see whether or not someone is above, equal, or below to you relative in HP
```
