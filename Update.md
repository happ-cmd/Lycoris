It attempts to parry instead of block with some added information in the notification.
**All "Medium Weapon" combat hitboxes have been changed, report any bad hitboxes.**

**New features?**
```diff
- (bug fix) Animation speed changer cycled through many random speeds in one timing
- (removed) "User is in hit animation" check is now removed
+ (added) Animation speed changer has new switch between speeds feature
+ (added) Aggressive auto feint type which ignores all player attacking checks
+ (changed) Auto feint now respects hyperarmor (this caused auto feint to be useless in PVE) (this data may be missing for some timings; please report if so)
+ (changed) Auto feint now runs another check a bit before the timing to combat feinting latency
